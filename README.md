This repository contains tutorial material and exercises made for A3Net AI/ML school in Osaka 2024.

The material consists of:
1) A notebook (CreateRingDatasets) to create all necessary datasets for this project, including the *N_ring_dataset* and the *single_ring_dataset*. This notebook also contains comments on the inspiration of this datasets and its relation to neutrino Astrophysics.
2) A notebook (MNISTClassifier) to show how one can perform classification on the MNIST (hand written numbers) dataset using a simple CNN, which is formatted in the exact same way as the datasets that are generated for this project. This is an introductory notebook.
3) A ring classifier (RingClassifier) notebook with functions to load an visualize the *N_ring_dataset* and associated exercise instructions.
4) A ring regressor (SingleRingRegressor) notebook with functions to load an visualize the *single_ring_dataset*, examples on how to perform regression on it using a CNN, and how to diagnose and study the results of the regression. At the end of the notebook there are associated exercise instructions.
5) A ring generator (RingGenerator) notebook with functions to load an visualize the *single_ring_dataset*, and to train using it a simple generative model and to visualize the data of the generated examples. Associated exercise instructions can be found at the end of the notebook.
